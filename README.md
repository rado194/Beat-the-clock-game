               =========================== BEAT THE CLOCK ============================

* Initial project planning:
When the project was first displayed to us, I instantly thought about doing Break out as it is a childhood favourite game, however I also remembered about the fact that from time to time I like to practice my typing skills on keyboard speed games and decided to shift my plans towards that. 

* Summary:
In order to play, the user has to select the difficulty first. There are 3 different levels which are - easy, medium and redbull. Each level you have a certain amounts of seconds to type the given word on the screen and the harder the level is, the less seconds you have to type. Afterwards, press "Start" and place mouse cursor on the empty text bar to start playing. In order to play again, press "Reset" and repeat process of selecting difficulty and pressing "Start" button.

* Recommendations:
Desktop users: In order to play, it is preferable you o an operating keyboard and mouse, in order to press on the box where you type the words and initiate the starter.


* Development Experience:
 Due to being new to developing, I managed to see that my other colleagues build the simple features and game first, and then had a plan on what features to implement and how much time it would take them to do so. After exchanging information and advice from them and my tutor, I was able to learn as I go and learn different ways to implement each feature of the game. 
I was enshuring to test after each feature or function to see if it works and try to find the mistakes first and then move on to the next objective. I was trying also to put as much as comments and explanation into my code as possible, in order to when I or my tutor comes back to it for reference, to be able to understand the information easier. As mentioned, the webb was very helpful when tackling various issues and I can say with confidence that this project has allowed me to gain significant experience in my research skills and being able to understand the issue and how to tackle it. I learned that there are different ways to solve a problem and also when it comes to development and testing programmes or games, you have to learn to think more of the machine's perspective and what it sees rather than what the user sees. 

* Bugs
As I did not fully have time to get rid of all the minor bugs of the game, some of them still exist:
 - after selecting the difficulty and starting the game, when you type the first word you have 6 seconds remaining, instead of how many are set for each difficulty. 
 - after pressing "Reset" the "difficulty" tab moves up and touches the typing box. 
 
 
* Future improvements
If I could improve the game in the future, I would probably add more sounds to make it more interactive, I would have a box which displays the words that are suppose to come after the one you type so the user is able to have better experience and maybe even set up a level system where after each level the words get harder and the timer is reduced more. At the moment, there is no development for mobile platforms and this is one function that I would add in future developments. As well as create an API that draws the data out of another website instead of having a hardcoded array of randomly generated words.






 ===========Project Plan deliverables: =============
 - Scope :
 0.1 What are you aiming to build?  - browser based game for speed typing
 0.2 What features will it have? - Initial game will have an instructions box, a list of 30-40 words which will be selected randomly for ''next word box'' , bar with ''next word'', box where to fill next words, timer and score, indicatior when game will finish
 0.3 What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period? - Imput a select list(settings) in which user can select difficulty level (easy,medium,hard), having a high-score box which keeps the current highest score to beat for each difficulty, get words list from API, make border different color when game is over, add image when the game is over to appear

 - Milestones :
 Monday - try to create initial game interface.
 Tuesday - compare efforts and result with Rob and the group and receive feedback
 Wednesday - work to correct mistakes and on to add additional features
 Thursday - finish off the game and ensure it is working as well as work on presentation
 Friday - present to group

 1. Presentation Milestones :
  - be able to explain how I went on to doing the project and the steps I took to make the game
  - show additional features and how the game is played
  - show off with incredible typing speed and hope for additional bonus points for presentation
